Her second book, Tanri G&#271;rmesin Harflerimi (1999) was warmly greeted. Two further books appeared at the same time in 2002, Ayin B&#277;y&#277;tt&#277;gu Ogullar and Onun &#224;&#271;l&#277;nde, continuing the distinctive language and world of imagery special to herself and her poetry.

Her translated book in German and French published in Louxambourg by PHI publishing house.

chahdortt_djavann

Chahdortt Djavann was born in 1967 in Iran. Chahdortt Djavann claims to have been "born a rebel". Born a rebel because she was born in a country where women do not have the right to exist. She grew up in Tehran, raised by her mother along with four older brothers and sisters. Her father, Pacha Khan, was imprisoned by the Shah, after the revolution of 1979. Even as a child, Chahdortt was not afraid to voice her beliefs, and despite the government's oppression, she had a clear understanding of freedom and a taste for it.  A real tomboy, she stood out, and at a very young age, she was exiled: after a short stay in Istanbul, she arrived in Paris in 1993. Life there was hard at first; she didn't speak the language.  After a series of odd jobs, she was accepted into the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales where she studied anthropology. In 1998, she defended her Master's thesis on religious indoctrination: an analysis of elementary school textbooks in Iran. A year later, she focused her studies on the socio-linguistic issues concerning immigration. In 2002, she published her first novel, Je viens d'ailleurs, written in French, to tell her story. A year later, Bas les voiles! which condemned the Muslim veil worldwide, earned Chahdortt sudden notoriety as well as several threatening phone calls. In September 2004, she was again brought into the limelight, this time for the publication of Que pense Allah de l'Europe? (translated into German and Italian). Her articles and interviews are periodically published in the French national press (Le Point, Liberation, le Figaro, Elle, etc.).

anna_moi

Anna Mo&#239; was born in Saigon, the then capital of the Republic in the southern part of war-stricken Vietnam, in 1955. I feared the war throughout my childhood, remembers the daughter of a liberal educator and an officer and journalist. She was educated early on in French schools and after leaving high school at the Lyc&#233;e Marie Curie moved to France. She started studying History at the University of Nanterre, aiming at becoming a journalist, but soon migrated towards the fashion industry. She then worked as a fashion designer in Paris and Bangkok and lived for some time in Tokyo. She speaks many languages including Vietnamese, French, English, Thai, Japanese and some German. In 1992 she moved back to her home city, now called Ho Chi Minh City.
Here she began to write in French, her second mother tongue, and initially published two slim volumes of short stories presenting scenes from everyday life, penned with humour and discretion. In L'&#233;cho des rizi&#232;res (2001; t: The echo of the paddy fields), the author abruptly combines impressions of Western and Eastern culture from different temporal planes. She writes with as much ease of the Vietnamese plateaus as of a swimming pool in the south-east of France, an ordinary apartment block in downtown Ho Chi Minh City and the island paradise Phu Quoc. Following her second volume, Parfum de pagode (2003; t: Pagoda Perfume), Mo&#239; turned to the novel and her work shifted both in theme and key. Riz noir (2004; t: Black Rice) focuses on the sore afflictions of the country's past and describes the fate of two young sisters who were arrested, tortured and interned by South Vietnamese forces. The author intended the work, based on a true incident, also to be understood as a homage to "the fragile and invincible" Vietnamese women. Her second novel, Rapaces (2004; t: Birds of Prey), takes place during the period of French colonial rule and evokes important moments in the country's history, such as the great famine of the winter of 1944/45. The protagonist is a sculptor who becomes involved unwillingly and against his unheroic disposition with the incipient struggle against French colonial powers, and is unable to shake off his feelings of guilt. Mo&#239;'s latest novel, Violon (2006; t: The Violin) appeared recently, telling the story of a young woman who suffers from dyslexia and grows up in a family dominated by women.
The author was awarded the prize for the best French-language d&#233;but novel at the Festival du premier roman in Cuneo. In 2006 she was named a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres for her creations in the artistic and literary field and for her contribution to the dissemination of arts and sciences in France and the world. Mo&#239; lives in her native city, where she occasionally performs as a singer, and runs a boutique that sells her designs which are exported as far as to the USA and Japan.

peter_esterhazy

Peter Esterhazy (1950-) is one of the most prominent contemporary authors in Hungarian literature, brought about a turn of Hungarian prose. He was barely 25 when his first collection Fancsiko and Pinta,  - stories pulled on a string -  was published. As Miklos Meszoly said, Esterhazy's  prose brought "ontological happiness"  into Hungarian literature.  In  1979 the Novel of Production with its ironical reference to factory novels in the 1930s in the Soviet Union created a literary sensation. In 1986 Introduction into Literature created a firm place for the post-modern novel in Hungary. His last major novel Harmonia Caelestis (2000), the Latin title of a composition that was compiled by one of Esterhazy's forefathers in the eighteenth century. Throughout his career Esterhazy has generated controversy  concerning the interpretation of his work, but there is no doubt of his role in changing mainstream Hungarian fiction by rejecting the traditional conventions of narrative prose in favor of the linguistic and stylistic techniques of literary postmodernism. In the course of the evening we will present excerpts of Esterhazy's prose, essays and plays.

On the surface of her work are rich sound and variation of rhythm and line. A few steps deeper in lie wells of feeling and complexities of thought." Moldaw was born in Oakland, California, and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. From 2005-2008 she was on the faculty of Stonecoast, the University of Southern Maine's low-residency M.F.A. program, and has conducted residencies at the Vermont Studio Center, taught at the College of Santa Fe and in the MFA program at Naropa University.
