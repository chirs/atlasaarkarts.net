<p><span class="author_name">Fred D'Aguiar.</span> Poet, novelist and playwright Fred D'Aguiar was born in London in 1960 to Guyanese parents. He lived in Guyana until he was 12, returning to England in 1972. He trained as a psychiatric nurse before reading African and Caribbean Studies at the University of Kent, Canterbury, graduating in 1985. His first collection of poetry, <em>Mama Dot</em> (1985), was published to much acclaim and established his reputation as one of the finest British poets of his generation. Along with <em>Airy Hall</em> (1989), it won the Guyana Poetry Prize in 1989 and was followed by <em>British Subjects</em> (1993). His first novel, <em>The Longest Memory</em> (1994), tells the story of Whitechapel, a slave on an eighteenth-century Virginia plantation and won both the David Higham Prize for Fiction and the Whitbread First Novel Award. It was adapted for television and televised by Channel 4 in the UK. His long poem 'Sweet Thames' was broadcast as part of the BBC 'Worlds on Film' series in 1992, winning the Commission for Racial Equality Race in the Media Award. Fred D.Aguiar was Judith E. Wilson Fellow at Cambridge University (1989-90), Visiting Writer at Amherst College, Amherst, MA (1992-4), and was Assistant Professor of English at Bates College, Lewiston, ME (1994-5). More recently he was Professor of English and Creative Writing at the University of Miami. Currently he teaches creative writing and literature at Virginia Tech in Virginia, USA where he is Professor of English and Gloria D. Smith Professor of Africana Studies. His plays include <em>High Life</em>, which was first produced at the Albany Empire in London in 1987, and <em>A Jamaican Airman Foresees His Death</em>, performed at the Royal Court Theatre, London, in 1991. He is also the author of the novels <em>Dear Future</em> (1996), set on a fictional Caribbean island, and <em>Feeding the Ghosts</em> (1997), inspired by a visit D'Aguiar made to the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool and based on the true story of a slave who survived being thrown overboard with 132 other men, women and children from a slave ship in the Atlantic. Recent poetry includes <em>Bill of Rights</em> (1998), a long narrative poem about the Jonestown massacre in Guyana in 1979, and a new long narrative poem, ,em>Bloodlines</em>, the story of a black slave and her white lover, published in 2000. Fred D'Aguiar's fourth novel, <em>Bethany Bettany</em> (2003), is centred on a five-year-old Guyanese girl, Bethany, whose suffering symbolises that of a nation seeking to make itself whole again. His chapbook of poems, <em>The Giants of Land's End</em>, was published this year by Aark Arts.  His new poetry book, <em>Continental Shelf</em>, comes out in May 2009 from Carcanet, in the UK. His novel manuscript, <em>Naming the Dead</em>, about the mass suicides and murders in Jonestown, Guyana in 1978 is in search of a publisher. He'll read from this manuscript at the Delhi Festival. freddaguiar.com</p>
