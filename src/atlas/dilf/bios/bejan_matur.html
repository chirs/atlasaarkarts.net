<p><span class="author_name">Bejan Matur</span> was born of an Alevi Kurdish family on 14 September 1968 in the ancient Hittite city of Maras in southeast Turkey. Her first school was in her own village; later she attended the long-established Lyc&#258;e in the region's most important cultural centre Gaziantep. These years were spent living with her sisters far from their parents. She studied Law at Ankara University, but has never practised. In her university years, she was published in several literary periodicals. Reviewers found her poetry "dark and mystic". The shamanist poetry with its pagan perceptions, belonging to the past rather than the present, of her birthplace and the nature and life of her village, attracted much attention. Her first book, <em>R&#277;zgar Dolu Konaklar</em>, published in 1996, unrelated to the contemporary mainstream of Turkish poets and poetry, won several literary prizes. Her second book, <em>Tanri G&#271;rmesin Harflerimi</em> (1999) was warmly greeted. Two further books appeared at the same time in 2002, Ayin B&#277;y&#277;tt&#277;gu Ogullar and Onun &#224;&#271;l&#277;nde, continuing the distinctive language and world of imagery special to herself and her poetry. Her poems has been translated into many languages. She has an translated book Which published by ARC in England, called <em>In the temple of a patient god</em>. Her translated book in German and French published in Louxambourg by PHI publishing house. Her last book, Ibrahim'in Beni Terketmesi, published in March 2008, is considered by the critics to be her best book ever. Since 2005 she writes articles for the opinion column of daily newspaper called ZAMAN. Bejan Matur, who believes there is no frontier between poetry and life, travels the world like a long-term desert nomad. She stops by Istanbul, a city she sometimes lives in.</p>
