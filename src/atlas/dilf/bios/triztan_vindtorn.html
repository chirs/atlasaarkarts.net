Since then he has continued travelling, and has published numerous books of poetry strongly influenced by impressions from his travels. Among these books are two books of poetry from China, as well as from Mexico and Brazil. He considers Brazil one of the main reasons for his starting to write poetry seriously.</p>

He also sat on the negotiating committee that negotiated working conditions and wages for the theatre employees with the State representatives.

<p>He has also been bestowed knighthood by Drakabygget in 2005. Drakabygget is an artists’ center in Skåne, Sweden, founded in 1960 by the painter brothers Jørgen Nash and Asger Jorn, the latter world famous for his contribution to the international painters’ movement COBRA.</p>

In Norway he has taken an active part in most important literary festivals, like Molde Literary Festival (the Bjørnson Festival), Lillehammer Literary Festival, Oslo Poetry Festival, Stavanger International Literary Festival, and the International Poetry Festival at Håkonshallen (Bergen).</p>
<p>Many of his poems have been translated into other languages – 19 different languages in all - and published in anthologies, literary magazines, newspapers and student publications and the like.</p>
<p>Triztan Vindtorn often works with visual techniques and effects, contentum, scenic versions, and has collaborated with musicians from the world of jazz. He has contributed to several CD productions, in Germany and Japan in addition to Norway.</p>
