<h4 class="yellow">The Pendulum of Love</h4>

You divided me
breaking up as I bled in the middle of the night
the bridges of my inner city collapsed
Eleni was a paper woman
a speck of paint, a little sadness
and the simple story of womanhood,

You were a pendulum of love
touching her touching me
then you stopped at her
- the choice of defeat
whereas spell was in motion -

You came and went
to her to me
hurting with each touch

You divided me
you stabbed me with your pain like a knife
then you mourned my death

I am looking at your eyes
to what far away land have they gone
you the drop of love flowing to me
it is finished you say
then let barbed wire fall in between

I am looking at your empty space
the aching echo of your orphaned love
there is never a winner in this war
Eleni a ruin worse than I

To love?
I have also loved many man
and still do
the miracle is elsewhere
the city beyond loving
the night I have found you
inside inside me

Talking of separation
I suddenly realise
how deep your presence
how crowded the city
how tight this knot

As I sighed
fires began in every cell
I remembered I did have a past
I remembered I am in a world
in the night as naked inner pain

Now I think everything is a lie
a divided city
still reaches itself

I am asleep in my grave
you throw handfuls of betrayals on me
I am waiting for that moment to arrive
and everything to change
for your arms to embrace me
and everything is a game, you see
forgive me my love forgive me

The city awakes
and everything flows as it should be
cars and the tomorrow of life to be continued
I wake into insanity
and look at the time you have vacated
to the hurtful words dangling in mid-air

Who cares
what is being lived in this house, at this moment
I have raked the years
and the sky is bleeding
I am looking for the music I have lost
in our body

Love is fiction
that’s what they will say
everyone can talk, and this is on everyone’s head
yet how strange
I am dying alone with the poison I have tasted.
a rare flower withers by my side

I am waiting
as though everything will change,
“Forgive me my love forgive me
in this world I have chosen you
paying the price in disgrace.”

How far how distant was that look
the wall of bloody wars in front of your eyes
How very true were your words
I was just like other women
as my soul crushed into your eyes
as it tore apart
as my skin ached

I hear the thunder
of those unyielding words
I am not a beetle to be destroyed
inside I am so vast so deep

How strange
the purification of oneself
with the violence of sorrow
am I so innocent, maybe not
who knows how I must have hurt you
for you to crush me and walk away like this

<em>translated by AYDIN MEHMET ALI</em>



<h4 class="yellow">Stark naked</h4>

Your poem a secretive mirror
where I saw myself with joy
from the shadow of a body
I walked to wonderlands
magical the power of your love

Howling winds, Howling winds, Howling winds
destroyed the tower I am locked in

A woman
firmly always holds 
dresses in love as she undresses

If you come ringing bells
I think you a snake
since torturers
stole the love from my body

Don't kiss me
your poisoned tongue my suicide
don't talk of me
in your voice the revenge of sorrows

What a crazy dance 
a love without gravity
losing itself in space 

A flower 
left on my table
a star fell asleep on the sheet
hang its voice on my breast
beating there
doors knocking
the tick-tack of the clock
holding my hand
your breath asleep in mine

(The rainbow flowed mud
as the arrow of separation sprang)

Leaving the mirror
an old woman's wrinkles under my eyes
I stripped love from my body
became stark naked
destitute, silent

be quiet 
no poet on earth can find
the lines to forgive you

<em>From the book, Kapilar (Doors), 1992</em>
<em>translated by AYDIN MEHMET ALI</em>



<h4 class="yellow">Unsent Letters </h4>

You took your voice and left
and I remained staring at your empty space
your footprints did not disappear
on the roads of loving

Glaring loneliness is what you left
even when you dais “you are not alone”

I have yet to grow up I am a lovebabe
my dreams those of an adolescent girl
I will come barefoot as everyone sleeps

In the same city
walls cut across my path
wait on the other side to run and embrace
since love is a bird

And you?

How can  a man love
overcoming all obligations
would he come head-over-heels in love

There is no access
even if you begin the journey
(Impossible without orders from the Commander)

I was going to say don’t love a poet
your fire silenced me
love is a national traitor

If I were to reach you
are you there?
On an island in the Mediterranean Sea

Love would emerge if you were to divide love
I don’t want it even independent federal

In two separate cells
to  love in silence
(This is a betrayal
of the rebel generation)


II

Your name
is like a knot inside me
I undo it
the soul pain and love seizures increase
if loving is not joyful
what’s the use?
I must submit a petition
(My request is obvious)
“Permission to cross the border to be granted due to longing.”
A lovesick flower
is dying
the guns turn on it
- Love has been detained in no-man’s land
it confessed to being a lunatic escapee

III

Even if I know nothing
I know everything
Love is the God of non-recognition of borders
I saw you in my dream
a bitter taste, confusion
you had said you were ill, I did not forget
even if around you always women
die in me if you die
don’t die
I die

IV

I am afraid
that this forbidden hope might be extinguished
it is inescapable for fire to become ash
I am mad I might just get up and come

And you?

Thief-of-hearts
thief-of-women’s-hearts-bird

And should you set me free
where shall I go?

Who shall understand my language
the love of a provincial girl

And if you were to fly away
what would I do?

I am afraid
You did not notice.


V

I only write poetry
if love exists, it can only be as poetry
it can only be crazy
overflowing uncontrollably, becoming the wind
if you can be, you are the one
only you become me

VI

In a musty cell
I am a tangled up ball of wool
This is not Berlin
Don’t expect me

I too expect you not to expect me

If they were to shoot us
what would remain

If anything was to be shot love would be
craziness in itself

If only the address of the two of us was the same.

VII

Today is my day without hope
no force can unite the United Nations
as long as Nations exist

I want peace
between woman and man

Can you not even fly me a message?
to love like a woman is the implication in the end



VIII

I am alone
I am so much you that I am so alone
so much a child
so much a woman
so much a poet

I am a flower, I have closed up
my joy only opens to you
I am alone.

IX

If they were to divide you by me
me by you
we remain in the end

I sit and write poetry
continue to burn by your side

If only I were your side
and you were my side

United we would become us

X

No permission to cross
in reality it is the traces of hope which disappear
days spent in longing have turned to grief
Don’t wait for me
in the other cell of sorrow

No access to love
(Our Army is our greatest security)
I kept looking at the stars tonight
hoping you were looking too

Your message for a meeting has reached me
in a different country
at a different time

But I can’t wait
the yellow snake called time
keeps writhing inside me

I have fallen into unpostponable longings
I must see you today

I will tell everyone I am in love with you
even the policeman at the check-point
I will tell everyone your forbidden name

I will then walk through
dressed like a cat

Wait for me
take me in your arms
I will say “miow” to you in Turkish.

XI

To touch you
first I need paper and pen
then hope
then tears

How can I touch you?

Climb up tall buildings
and look towards me
you will see that I love you
nothing else
(This love is an historical error)

XII
History buy me a Berlin
I want to take him in my arms
to run and run
to find him amongst the crowds
with hundred degree love
to return to each other

Add me to him, him to me
History buy me a Berlin.


XIII

My homeland
I felt you deepest in this love
history wrote with my tears
that I love you and him

They separated us
my heart is the most genuine document

Bury me to him
him to me
if one day we don’t become one

Let the tombstone say they had loved
History did not love those who loved

History
and who should love you?
