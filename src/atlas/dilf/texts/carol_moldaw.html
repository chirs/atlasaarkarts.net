<h4 class="yellow">64  Panoramic Way</h4>

Like  easy conversation,
rambling, obliquely angled,
the winding street traverses
the steep residential hill.

Stone stairs ladder-stitch
the street’s tiers; every few
rungs open on terraces,
windows glinting through hedges,

sunlight feathering grass.
At the first switchback,
pine needles tufted with dog fur
pad up the wide cracked steps

leading to a cottage and two
ramshackle shingle houses.
From the lintel of an illegal
basement apartment, magenta

fuchsia, silent bells,
bob and sag over a pot’s rim.
Higher, up wooden stairs
built over rubble, we climb

to the top deck. What was
our garden now grows wild
onions’ white flowers,
and butter-yellow weeds--

winter’s mohair throw
draping a bare mattress.
By late spring someone else
or no one will be bending

to pick cool herbs
like single guitar notes.
Something knots in my throat.
Indecipherable

decibels begin jackhammering
inside #D--our old address.
Black Sabbath? Iron Maiden?
I know our own records

by the first chord. Pounding,
we try the unlocked door,
and pick our way through
a year’s domestic fallout:

dropped clothes, album sleeves,
mattresses blocking entrances,
plates, cups, hangers, books.
I trip trying not to look.

Waving on the balcony,
an old guest, now our host,
offers us the view.
At this time of year,

no yellow beach roses 
tumble the latticed railing,
no draft of honeysuckle,
no bees flitting near their hive.

Cars nose around the hairpin turn.
Looking past Berkeley’s hazy
flat grids,  past Oakland,
you can see, as if you’ve flicked

a painted fan open, a striped
spinnaker tacking the wide bay,
three bridges, and San Francisco
shrugging off her damp negligee.



<h4 class="yellow">Report</h4>

The articulation of my bones
a bird’s, I woke not just not knowing
where or who but what I was:
my opened arm a wing in which she rested,
the two of us fuscous and fused
in the feathery half-dark
until that consciousness that’s always
roving, testing, that’s roving now,
striving to assemble an accurate report,
probed further into the feeling
and found me made of string and straw,
bits of silky floss licked together,
a nest shaped to fit her unfledged shape,
an account of ourselves I accepted
until daylight pried apart the louvers
and I discovered myself fingering
the soft stubble of her shaven hair.



<h4 class="yellow">Studies in Pen and Ink (#5)</h4>

The strawberry daVinci drew in cross-section
on one side of a notebook page bleeds through 

to cushion a fetus floating on the back.
By now, the ink has browned, the paper’s cracked,

dimly lit, encased upright and displayed 
in glass for us to circle, case after case

of notebook pages we pause before and pass 
in accelerating knots and curlicues--

the coition of a hemi-sected man 
and woman no more absurd or accurate

than a flying machine. A tube from the testicles, 
the seat of ardor, leads straight to the heart.

Once, in a videotape of surgery,
I saw fimbria wafting in the body’s fluid

like seaweed under water. The ovaries looked
like sponge or coral. Here, the woman’s heart’s

a dial. I hear my own timer ticking,
ticking fast, the parts dissected, tagged,

and reassembled, but never yet disarmed.
Or detonated. Here, here’s the blueprint,

recto and verso, marked up in mirror script.
The deeper I delve, the more I feel objective.

Pushed by the crowd, we rush through in under an hour:
a living page, one of the studies on water.



<h4 class="yellow">The Butterfly</h4>

<em>        	"The eye follows the hand,
        	 the mind follows the eye,
         	the heart follows the mind."
                       		 --from the Natya Shastra
</em>

With no appreciable weight,
a butterfly alit

and rode my finger
an hour or longer.

Holding my hand ahead,
I let the butterfly lead.

We walked down to the kill,
its wings an upright sail.

I was almost afraid to breathe,
but my feet knew the path:

its trippy roots, the snagging branches
with springs like rocket launches.

I sat down on a rock.
I couldn't believe my luck.

The world right then seemed kind,
with a butterfly on my hand,

its bronze wings spread flat,
pulsing to raise its body heat.

Like a fluttering eyelash,
it tickled the web of flesh

between forefinger and thumb.
"My life can never be the same!"

I thought, studying the leopard spots
of its eyes; its veins like pleats;

its scalloped scales; its legs,
six knobby little twigs;

the thorax's fuzzy patina;
the two slender antennae,

bulb-tipped, like matchsticks;
and the pointed black circumflex

markings on each scored wing:
accents from the mother tongue.

Its proboscis sipped 
the salt from my hand and tapped

out a secret code,
the secret names of God,

invisible to man,
imprinted on my skin.

If I could have become a fern--
a stone--a stalk of corn . . . .

Instead, my left hand twitched
and the butterfly detached

itself, all in a breath,
my article of faith,

momentarily tame
as if out of a dream,

now circling the rock,
not coming back.



<h4 class="yellow">The Peony</h4>

A man cups his fingers as if to bring them
to his lips to blow me a goodbye kiss,
or, as if he were Italian, to underscore
his words. He is not Italian; he is not
speaking; and he does not bring his fingers
to his lips. Gravely, they descend upon a peony
held up by the rim of its fishbowl vase.
Because I would be his, he tells me a secret
it is mine to know, all the while spreading
the silky petals with his slowly opening hand
so that the peony is made to bloom to its fullest, 
until it is an open globe, overbrimming the vase.
Only now do I think of those paper flowers
that blossomed when we floated them in water,
as girls. The words of the secret blurred
as soon as I woke, but his light hand 
gravely forcing the peony, that remains.

<h4 class="yellow">The Widening</h4>
   <p>At the crucial moment she said yes. His hand in the back pocket of her jeans had made her wet--but nothing and no one had prepared her. They were on her bed, at boarding school. Naked she was self-conscious, and self-conscious she was timid. He would know what to do if only she let him. She remembered letting herself be kissed when she was twelve, pulled into the bushes by a classmate, happily ambushed, but sure right up until the moment his lips pressed hers that she would not be kissed, no matter how long they sat nested in the shrubs, because it was forbidden. He dug in, the sharp pain snapping her out of her reverie, and knowing she could not bear it if she conceived, and she said no, pushing his shoulders hard with her hands. At once he was out, up, and through the door. Why had he left? In the bathroom, she looked and saw what she’d heard she’d find: blood. Her body pounded and throbbed, with the widening had come a great unremitting pressure on her bones and she ached inside. And that was it, she’d lost something she’d not examined having, something that until then had seemed irrelevant, illusory.</p>
