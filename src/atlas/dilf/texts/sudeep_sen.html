<em>from New Writing 15 (London: Granta, 2007)</em>

<h4 class="yellow">Mediterranen</h4>

     1

A bright red boat
Yellow capsicums

Blue fishing nets
Ochre fort walls

     2

Sahar’s silk blouse
gold and sheer

Her dark black
kohl-lined lashes

     3

A street child’s
brown fists

holding the rainbow
in his small grasp

    4

My lost memory
white and frozen

now melts colour
ready to refract



<em>from Prayer Flag (Peepal Tree, 2003) and Rain (Mapin/Gallerie, 2005)</em>

<h4 class="yellow">Offering</h4>

the kindness of libation, lyric, and blood

her endless notes left for me—
			little secrets, graces —
	trills recorded on blue and purple parchment
to be lipped, tasted, devoured—

only essence remains—
	its stickiness, its juice, its memory

seamless juxtaposition—
	the brute and the passion,
		dry of the bone and wet of the sea,
coarseness of the page and smooth of the nib’s iridium

I try and trace a line, a very long line—

	the ink blots
		as this line’s linear edges
dissolve and fray—

like capillary threads
	gone mad 
		twirling in the deep heat of the tropics—

threads unravelling,
	each sinew tense with the want of moisture
and the other's flesh

there are no endings here—
only beginnings—
			precious incipience— 

translucent drops of sweat
	perched precariously on her collar-bone
				waiting to slide,
roll unannounced into the gulleys 
that yearn to soak in the rain—

heart-beat shift 
the shape of globules
		as they alter their balance and colour,
changing their very point of gravity—

constantly deceiving the other

I stand, wanting—
	wanting more of the bone’s dry edge,
the infinite blur of desire, 
					the dream,
	the wet, the salt, the ink, 
and			the underside of her skin



<em>from The Lunar Visitations (New York, 1990) & Postmarked India: New & Selected Poems 
(HarperCollins, 1997) / also appears in Confronting Love: Poems (Penguin, 2005)</em>

<h4 class="yellow">One Moonlit December Night</h4>

One moonlit December night
you came knocking at my door,
I took my time to open.
When I did,
there was just a silk scarf,
frayed, half-stuck in the latch.



<em>from Postmarked India: New & Selected Poems (HarperCollins, 1997) / also appears in Norton 
world poetry anthology Language of a New Century (New York: W.W.Norton, 2008)</em>

<h4 class="yellow">Flying Home</h4>

I meticulously stitch time through the embroidered sky,
  through its unpredictable lumps and hollows. I

am going home once again from another
  home, escaping the weave of reality into another

one, one that gently reminds and stalls
  to confirm: my body is the step-son of my soul.

But what talk of soul and skin
  in this day and age, such ephemeral things

that cross-weaves blood and breath
  into clotted zones of true escape.

What talk of flight time and flying
  when real flights of fancy are crying

to stay buoyant unpredictably in mid-air
  amid pain, peace, and belief: just like thin air

sketches, where another home is built 
  in free space vacuum, as another patchwork quilt 

is quietly wrapped around, gently, in memoriam.



<em>from Lines of Desire (USA) / also appears in Indian Love Poems 
(New York: Knopf  / London: Everyman’s Library, 2005)</em>

<h4 class="yellow">Desire</h4>

Under the soft translucent linen,
  the ridges around your nipples 

harden at the thought of my tongue.
  You — lying inverted like the letter ‘c’ —

arch yourself deliberately
  wanting the warm press of my lips,

it’s wet to coat the skin
  that is bristling, burning,

breaking into sweats of desire —
  sweet juices of imagination.

But in fact, I haven’t even touched 
  you. At least, not as yet.



<em>from Postmarked India: New & Selected Poems (HarperCollins, 1997) / 
also appears in The London Magazine, Acumen, Wasafiri, Gentleman, 
Gallerie International, Inlaks Foundation Book, Findings of Ice, & others.</em>

<h4 class="yellow">Bharatanatyam Dancer</h4>
<em>for Leela Samson</em>
	
Spaces in the electric air divide themselves
     in circular rhythms, as the slender 
grace of your arms and bell-tied ankles
   describe a geometric topography, real, cosmic,
   one that once reverberated continually in
a prescribed courtyard of an ancient temple

in South India. As your eyelids flit and flirt, and
     match the subtle abhinaya in a flutter
of eye-lashes, the pupils create an 
   unusual focus, sight only ciliary muscles 
   blessed and cloaked in celestial kaajal 
could possibly enact.

The raw brightness of kanjeevaram silk, of
     your breath, and the nobility of antique silver
adorns you and your dance, reminding us of
   the treasure chest that is only 
   half-exposed, disclosed just enough, barely —
for art in its purest form never reveals all.

Even after the arc lights have long faded,
     the audience, now invisible, have stayed over.
Here, I can still see your pirouettes, frozen 
   as time-lapse exposures, feel
   the murmuring shadow of an accompanist's 
intricate raga in this theatre of darkness, 

a darkness where oblique memories of my
     quiet Kalakshetra days filter,
matching your very own of another time,
   where darkness itself is sleeping light,
   light that merges, reshapes, and ignites,
dancing delicately in the half-light.

But it is this sacred darkness that endures,
     melting light with desire, desire that simmers
and sparks the radiance of your
   quiet femininity, as the female dancer 
   now illuminates everything visible: clear,
poetic, passionate, and ice-pure.

<h4 class="yellow">SCATTERED PIECES OF A QUARREL</h4>

<em>	We listen while a dustpan eats
	the scattered pieces of a quarrel.
			— Vern Rutsala</em>

Every night, for many years now I hear voices next door 
through the thin of the wall, every core

of the crackling scream, like an old 
stylus needle on a scratched gramophone record, 

stuck. Every night it happens, shriller and fiercer
every night. At midnight, the ritual starts over:

the first conversations barely audible,
then the decibel levels, a plateau of maimed muffles

before taking off sharply, into the crystal
air of coded cries, on a steep delirious climb until 

breaking glass-ware scatter smithereens
as the soprano of anguish startles a bluebird in 

the nest outside, on the terracotta ledge 
of my alcove. Every morning when the sun's edge

clears the neighbour’s roof, I sweep the apartment floor
trying to extricate rolls of dust from under the doors.

They somehow seem to huddle in fluffy balls
insulating the crevices between adjacent flats, the same wall

that simultaneously separates and shares, just like the array 
of dust coils clinging together, in fear of being swept away.



<em>from Edinburgh Review (2007) and Postcards from Bangladesh </em>

<h4 class="yellow">Prayer Call: Heat</h4>

<em>I wake cold, I who
Prospered through dreams of heat
Wake to their residue,
Sweat, and a clinging sheet.
—Thom Gunn, ‘The Man with Night Sweats’</em>


Outside, “Allah-u-Akbar” 
   pierces the dawn air —
It is still dark. 

Inside, electric light 
   powers strength 
to my feverish body. 

Mosque minaret 
   radiate prayer-calls 
all around —

like coded signals 
   emanating 
from old radio 

transmitter-towers — 
   relaying the dangers 
of heat in this stale air.

   *

A bare body 
   sleeps peacefully 
beside me — 

her face’s innocence, 
   and generous curve 
of her eye

lashes, try to sweep 
   away my 
skin’s excess heat, 

one that is fast 
   making my bones 
pale and brittle.

   *

A brief lull 
   lingers outside. 
I cannot hear 

the heavy lyrics, 
   their rhymes 
trying to invoke 

peace and respect, 
   their wafting baritone 
instilling faith. 

Such things 
   are luxuries 
for me now.

I lie, trying 
   to piece together 
the eccentric song 

of my own 
   inadequate breathing. 
It is a struggle.

   *

It is also a mystery. 
   Mystery of a body’s 
architecture, 

its vulnerability, 
   its efficient circulation —
they are perfect 

models I remember 
   from school’s 
very early lessons.

They are only 
   how things ought to be, 
not how they are.

   *

Only now, I realise 
   the intent 
of prayer’s persuasion,

its seductive expression. 
   I also value 
the presence and grace 

of the body that willingly 
   lies next to me, 
as her breath 

tries to realign my will’s 
    magnetic imprint, and 
my heart’s irregular beat. 

My vision is awash 
   with salt 
of her night-sweat. 

My hearing is trapped 
   within diaphragm’s 
circuitous drone — 

in Arabic’s passion 
   that etches 
its parabolic script, 

sung loud 
   so that no 
slant or serif 

can be erased, 
   altered 
or misunderstood.

   *

Religion’s veil 
   and chiffon — 
its sheer black 

and translucence, 
   its own desire 
to give and want, 

its ambition 
   to control 
and preserve. 

Such songs 
   mean nothing 
to me 

if one’s own 
   peace and privacy 
remain unprotected, 

or, are not at ease. 
   I want 
the chant’s passion, 

its heat 
   to settle 
my restlessness. 

I want the song 
   to soothe 
my nerve-ends 

so that the pain 
   subsides
and faith’s will 

enables to rise. 
   I also want 
the beauty 

of this faith 
   to raise 
its heat —

not body-heat — 
   but the heat 
of healing.

   *

But for now, 
   the diaphanous lull 
is a big boon. 

Here, I can calculate 
   the exact path 
of my body’s 

blood-flow, 
   its unpredictable 
rise and fall 

of heat, and 
   the way it infects 
my imagination.

*

I step out 
   of the room’s 
warm safety. 

I see 
   the morning light 
struggling 

to gather muscle
   to remove 
night’s cataract.

   *

Again, 
   the mosques threaten 
to peel 

their well-intentioned 
   sounds —
to appease us all. 

But I see 
   only darkness, 
and admire it — 

I also admire 
   the dignity and gravity 
of heavy-water 

and its blood —
   its peculiar 
viscous fragility, 

its own struggle 
   to flow, 
sculpt and resuscitate.

   *

In quiet’s privacy, 
   I find 
cold warmth 

in my skin’s 
   permanent sweat, 
in its acrid edge, 

and in my own 
   god’s 
prayer-call.
