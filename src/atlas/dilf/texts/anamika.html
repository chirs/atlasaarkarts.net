<h4 class="yellow">THE 17 YEAR  OLD EXAMINEE</h4>
<em>Stra Sal Ka…</em>

Child,  when the milk first flows down  
from   the mother’s breast 
she shivers with milk fever
That milk isn’t very delicious 
but the doctors say  —
  If the child suckles
  then the baby will survive all diseases 

The taste of first failure is like that   —
Whatever happens,   it doesn’t matter
(no dead-ends)
whatever you lose,  doesn’t matter
there’s no full stop in life
The desire to go beyond desire
too is a desire	
The process doesn’t stop,  the road doesn’t break apart 
They twine 
around your feet like a liana 
and when you come back home and take off your shoes
there’ll be traces of them clinging to your socks
sorry about this strange world you’ve inherited
forgive me if you can
no one actually listens to the sound of flowers bursting open
no one sees with what skill and patience each petal unfolds 
This is the fruit market, child —  
fruitful and fruitless
I wish you could have inherited a world
where no one would have an identity divided and torn into different rows  

Every flower is beautiful in its own way
and beauty is beyond competition
You stay up all night your chair
all your work on your desk
watching the shrew on its catwalk
As you doze off you have a nightmare —
a shrew with an ounce
of jasmine oil on its head
and a buffalo
someone’s playing a pipe to
all falling on deaf ears  a silk purse for sows…
and everything out of whack 
and at break of dawn,   a truck
loaded with bricks.
When the bricks fall
the nightmare comes to an end.

They make you sit up
and then you ask:
  Ma,  why this sorrow
  What is it?
  What to do with it?

These shriveled breasts of mine are wet,
not with milk
but with sweat
I’m not Mahamaya
nor is he Buddha  —
but the question remains
 as it is  —
In an old film song
there ran a line in  Italian 
    Che sara,  sara?
  ‘What will be,  will be’

Don’t ask what comes next
Whatever happens  will happen for the best.
I sing out of tune and he breaks into laughter
   “Enough, mama,  enough
     I remember the rest of it”
This free laughter
in the dead of night
falls on the leaves like dew
His father,   worried about the future
smiles vaguely in his sleep
This half-smile of his gets the superserious house in a festive mood!

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">DALAI LAMA</h4>

The Dalai Lama continues to laugh
addressing
a large audience.

The interpreter is super-serious
has no time for laughter
The English was like a net
the Tibetan words butterflies
flew from the flower-petal lips of the Dalai Lama
sometimes to sit on the ears of the Tibetan kids
sometimes on the gold-flecked robes, 
maybe the wedding dresses
of the Tibetan women 
taken out only on special occasions
but worn away at the hems
this bit of sparkle left
like the trace of light  in aged eyes.

The Dalai Lama was expounding
on the Four Noble Truths of Buddhism
He raised his arm and 
like three little dots of ‘therefore’
there were the marks of childhood vaccination
peeping through his ochre robe.
They whispered:
   aha   someone is talking about such high principles
	but is from this very world
	this very epoch
	and he’s just a  man.

Right in front of me, rapt,   a grandfather
on his shoulder  a chubby little boy and his gurgling (bottle )
wiping his running nose
on grandpa’s sweater —
He must have been like that  —
the Dalai Lama
What do we know of Tibet  —
Rahul Sanknityayan or Rinpoches
monasteries and chow mein
cheap sweaters and sandals,  China,
snow, lost eyes,  round faces and faithful Lhasa Apso pups.

How do those noble truths
connect with
such random bits,
the ignoble truths of life?

Does truth too have hierarchies?
A Caste system?  —
Brahmin truths at the top 
and then the Shudra truths at the bottom?

Hunger and
thirst
heat and cold
attachment and cruelties
Love and hate  —
are these truths really lower?

Dalai Lama,  You tell me:  please
if the truth is like these mountain ranges —
high and low.
I prefer living in the deep cave of a small truth
occasionally coming to you
to learn the nobler truths of life.

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">DECEIT</h4>
<em>DoKa </em>

Some lies are stark white
as white as newly-born lambs
soft and warm,   teeny-weeny

Some are
pale-yellow petals
like those flowers in the vases you get in hospitals
They’ve got the laugh of a helpless father
when a child begs for a toy moon 
Mother pats him and says,  ‘ ok, tomorrow,
	now go to sleep.”

Now is this deceit?

This life, like the gentle nodding of a drowsy child
pretending
to be asleep.
Now,  in my part of the world
we had a special dish called “deceit”
made out  of chickpea flour
but which looked just like a fish
Those who couldn’t afford fish
cooked up this ‘deceit’
There ran a story that there was a guy who couldn’t afford
delectable magur fish
So he sat with a plate of rice on the bank of the river
Pointing at the fish riding the wave
he filled his mouth, one ball of rice at a time,
telling himself:
	that fish
	and this rice
	this rice
	and that fish 

So then did he
cook himself up a deceit?
Even starving
people can serve up ‘deceit.’

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">DILEMMA</h4>
<em>DuivDa</em>

Dilemma
is a little bird
with a nest in the heart of a scarecrow,
sits on its shoulder and twitters and cheeps
a blue and yellowish bird
blue as the welts on someone’s back
as pale a yellow as the girl
after the first time she got bawled out by her husband

pale yet as intent and firm
as a vow
In a rage,  the scarecrow sometimes shrugs its shoulders
One frosty night on his earthen pot face
there’s a trace
of worry
and he asks —
in the same old boorish way 
like a misplaced fear
  
              I am a creature of wood
  inside my wooden being
  say,   bird, are you still there?

The bird replies:   
 
   Scarecrow of mine, I’m there
   still alive
   in the pocket of your tattered coat
   as alive as a ray of hope
   in spite of  everything turned upside down
   in spite of  everything gone haywire 
   in spite  of never finding what or who  we  waited  for … .

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">DOOR</h4>

I was a door
the more they banged on me
the more I opened up
Those who could come in,  could see for themselves,
the endless cycle 
this whirling grindstone
to the spinning wheel
to the needle
something or other,  all day long, nonstop

and then a broom
to sweep it all up
the stars, swept up 
mountains,  trees, and rocks swept up
all the shards and wreckage dumped in an empty basket,
tossed in the attic of the mind.

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">GARLANDS ON THE THATCH ROOF</h4>

Chimneys, thatched roofs and fire-pots
play hopscotch in my grandmother’s dreams
The smoke doesn’t have anywhere to go
it spills out and then settles,  lingering under the bed,  
hovering between people.

Dried up flowers, leaf-packets,  leftover prasad,  garlands 
and things forbidden the touch of a broom
all balled up together and aimed at the thatch
till they got stuck there,  
left to shrivel up and turn into the five elements.

Whenever I look at her,  my grandma reminds me of those garlands  
poised in limbo on the thatch.
When my turn on the thatch comes,  
I won’t just lie there, sad about it—
I’ll make friends with the crows  perched  there  
have them recount the stories of Kakbhushundi
and ask them how Jayant-crow has been?
and one day,  I’ll fly away on the wings of the crow of my choice
beyond all limits and limitlessness.
So what if they’ve got raucous voices
not just fair weather friends, 
at least, they come every day!

What good are those great artists
who like the koel,  every so often  make guest-appearances 
in low-budget films 
and lives.

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">HANDS UP </h4>

Doctors in films in the 60s
get down from their buggies
with someone else trotting behind them
carrying their bags
all-important,  with heavy footsteps
come to examine
the heroine’s mother.

Stethoscope here,  there,
looking concerned,  lips pursed
they raise their hands to the sky
and say,  in a solemn voice:
      “now no medicines,  only prayers can cure her!”

God only knows what’s gone wrong.
All of us,  hands reaching for the sky
stand defeated
Are we praying,
or 
has someone behind the scenes 
roared: 
	“Hands Up!!”?

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">HOMEWORK</h4>

I’m tired now,  mom
you do the next assignment
I don’t have a clue what my teacher wants!

	to  “fill in the blanks”,  she says —
	How do you do these,  son?
	This is an art I’ve never mastered
	I’ve always left blank spaces blank
	and, after all,  in a way
everyone’s  life is crammed  with empty spaces 
fissures and dashes

But empty spaces are all haunted by ghosts of the past, mama,  right?

	Sometimes haunted too,   by ferocious ghosts of the present

 Then let’s fill them in not with words, but with modeling clay

	The sky has already come down in the blanks
	we  can leave the spaces that way
		but the sky rushes in to fill in empty spaces
				
All these blanks then turn into sky,  ma?
	
It’s because of those blanks,
	that the sky is so vast

all the voids in everyone’s life
	leave the earth slowly behind, 
            rise and turn 
into the blue of the sky

<em>Translation from Hindi by  Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">KNOWING</h4>

Knowing someone is like buying another mirror for yourself
and another set of earphones, good ones
which let you hear distinctly.

After all, what does the  bhatkoinya  berry say as parting words
to the stunned silence of the fields sold away
If you listen closely,  you can even hear
the sad laughter of old prostitutes
like swabs of cotton  from some unknown mythic epoch
entering your space
you can hear rag jaijavanti  on the  ektara
of an ancient madman in the oldest asylum in the world.
You can hear the whooping cough of the prisoner playing his chains
to the rhythm of   ‘jhan-jhan-jhan’,
playing on the rhythm of crimes done/undone.
and then,  you can hear the double entendre 
of all the established rules
and the soft thuds of languages almost dead
Each word difficult
but strong enough 
to pull you into the fold of the  mysterious naglok,  the world of serpents.
Deep inside the waters
sunk within  these waters
without a straw to hold onto 
slowly, slowly   turned  into serpent jewels:

Knowing someone is a passionate leap
first outside your being
and then deep within it 
It sends out ripples on the surface of the waters
over the pond for a long time.
Knowing someone is to become  pond, river, ocean and rain.
Knowing is a departure
Clouds rain once
trees three times
after every rain,  when you shake their branches
Knowing someone is like
gradually remembering 
all things,  forgotten, 
sunk deep in memory

Knowing someone is
becoming
trembling leaves
catching raindrops.

<h4 class="yellow">LITTLE MAGAZINES</h4>

These are the squirrels of the forest
They slip beneath the door making their way into your house
In the afternoons they watch you dozing off
go around and inspect everything 
in every nook and cranny of your house
like  chowkidars 
see if everything’s okay 

Along the trails of mythic time and space
they come to you
but seem inexhaustible 

quest-smitten,  always scampering,  restless
they come like CID spies
twirling the pollen-grains caught in their whiskers  
Their cummerbunds and belts, undetectable, done up in invisible boots
twisting their heads back and forth
always on the alert
aware of the meter of ‘pause and pace’,  accented, unaccented
the movement of free verse,    
Clenching between their teeth  those straws 
people drowning in the river of time cling to —
Straws from broken nests
when the branches of history were hacked off.
the tree trunk hollows they come from
are where forest-goddesses
shelter their jeweled serpents
In the deadly difficult nights of the jungle
when the petromax of the moon fails
the jewels glow
like flashlights
	see how the hardworking squirrels
	scurry back and forth
still working to raise Rameshwaram’s bridge
across the ocean.

<em>Translation  from Hindi by  Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">MOSQUITO NET</h4>

There was a town,  a small one
a little too hot.
The heat laid them all low / flat/ half-dead
Birds built their nests
on the blades of  the electricity-less  fans // on the blades of the useless/ unmoving/ 
lifeless/ frozen/ immobile/ motionless/ still fans
Even so,  there was a chaos /.racket/ hubbub/ din/ tumult of people  ,  still
The darkness was festive /alive with festivity / celebration 
Right/ Just  after sunset, the mosquito nets were ceremoniously hung  //hung 
with ceremony
one end knotted to the branch of a guava tree
one end tied to the nose of a latch
one end to a nail
and the fourth end into outer space
Old uncle moon
was a silver knot
tied to the net
One night a hyena came// there came a hyena
and shaken out of sleep,  the people ran away/ off
the mosquito nets
were left hanging
over empty beds
For years, they’ve hung like this
No one bothers to fold  them up
No longer can you hear the jingle of bangles
blue, yellow, red
size 2
Now, whenever a storm springs up/ comes (up)
the frames of the mosquito nets  tremble/ wobble/shake
but won’t let them go	
like white toy kites   the nets fly up
bound on all sides

People turn over in sleep
on distant footpaths
Even in sleep their 
hoarse breaths tunnel
through their blocked-up / clogged / choked (-up)  / stopped-up  lungs
All night their rumbling sound,  gharr gharr, 
ghar ghar  1

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<em>Those who walk within confines are men,
those who walk beyond are saints.</em>

<h4 class="yellow">MOBILE</h4>

No confines for me,   no confines
a closed fist is my boundary wall

I can go wherever I want
but in this man’s pocket

I can connect to anyone anywhere
but always under his thumb.

Even when he’s dead asleep
he’ll tuck me under his pillow
listening to the tick tock tick of his wristwatch.
The whole night through 
quietly I’ll keep all his messages
coming from all over the world.

Those silent messages will glow
in my dark spaces 
They’ll glow like the cats-eyes
of my  dream-memories:
   Mother’s ailments
   filed court cases
   all the office scuffles
   all the rush of unfinished kisses 
   all the muffled calls
the faint quivers of many a held-in sob all flicker within me. 
In me flutter the wounded wings of messenger-pigeons  
each feather yanked out  and flicked off one by one
once in a while, even a pat on the wing.
No matter how modern the world may be
the expression of love and hate are primordial.

I’m like the roads of old Baghdad
before the American bombings
Parallel to the modern malls
are the old  souks  and  the meena bazaar
glittering inside me
like archeological ruins dotting the heart of the metropolis.

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">SNAP-BUTTON</h4>

My brother explained this to me:
Stars
are the snap-buttons sewn on the jacket of night.

In my part of the world,   snaps
were called chutputia
because with the click of a  ‘chut’ one snapped into the other
They only worked when all four eyelets on both sides matched up.

They had no faith in the high and the low
Advocates of equality
neither hooking nor getting hooked up
came together without a fuss.

In my part of the world 
snaps  were called “chutputia”
but even the people from my part of the world
behaved like snaps.

No chutputia  here in this alien city
like  sweet gourd,  satputia  jhigune
you just can’t find them,  can’t find them anywhere.

chutputia people  and chutputia snaps on sari blouses,
tailors in the city sew on hooks,   not snaps
and there’s always a gap
between the hook and the snare of the eye.
No matter how hard you try, no click of ‘chut’  and no  ‘put’.

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">THE FIRST STATE-SPONSORED TOUR OF A WOMAN</h4>

She entered the hotel room
shook hands warmly
with her solitude.
The room was dark
Inside her too the pitch-dark of a well
Fumbled along all the walls
but no light-switch
A wide open door
just a trace of light from the verandah
A bearer,  passing by 
She looked at him, not knowing what to do 
He understood  
and closed the door  
As soon as the door closed
the lamps on the walls blossomed
in a lotus of light.
She wondered about 
the relation between shutting the world out 
and having your share of light
Stretched out on the yielding mattress 
still could feel the straw chattai of home
poking into her spine
Is every woman a princess then
and that pea
It’s those ancient memories
that’s the pea 
poking through seven mattresses
She had lots of things to read
instead leafed through the telephone directory
to find out the exact rates for an international call —
then spent all of her dollars
on three separate calls — 
first to her son:
	“Hello, hello, darling
	I keep remembering
	how you dozed off on my clothes in the suitcase.
	You are my dearest.” 
	In each call  , she said  this,  both to her beloved
sitting irritably in his office imagining wild things 
and to her worried mother dropping pots and pans all over the kitchen.


Now she was held captive by the angels, brought before the throne of God 
     How dare she 
     use this tongue to call them all  her ‘dearest’?
  
God put down his pen and said   —
    After all, she’s a woman,   
    All her dear ones are her ‘ dearest.’

<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and  the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">THE HUSBAND’S WOMAN</h4>

Like in the British Raj
The sun never sets

Here in this house
the sun’s always ablaze,
scorching
even when the lord’s away 
he’s still there
in his claws, in his seal
in his towel, his walking stick,
his stamp papers, shoes and sandals,
in his drunken hiccoughs,  burping and his snores.
And his frowns, 
his threats and swear words.
Those are left behind.

He entered the house with a fierce roar
and in the very first round
she played dead
  like the man in the Russian folktale
  who thought the bear wouldn’t pounce 
  on someone already dead.

Once someone told her:
	cowards die  a thousand deaths,
	the brave only one
Why should you play dead 
when you are not actually at fault?

After that she felt ashamed of dying every day.
Every day she hesitated for a while
and then decided
to play dead again
She thought — if I had to be a bird,
		 why an ostrich
		 and if someone had to sniff at me and catch my tongue
		 why a snake?

Later someone told her to read Gandhi
now when beaten black and blue she fasted unto death.
But,  the fifth evening, she started to expect 
someone to take notice.
In vain.

One day,  her reeling head in her hands
she staggered to the kitchen
and slowly pulled out
a stale chapatti
moistened it with the salt of her tears.

So friends,
such was the life of virtuous wives in Kaliyug …

The story goes on
and the last part from the mouth of the sati  herself.
	
I don’t know what’s happened
	can’t get angry
	my heart is always as boggy as the soil
	after a heavy downpour on an unpaved road.
	He’s got a lot of work
	and he doesn’t even have his health
now he no longer has  the stamina
to shriek, or scold or even
 		beat me black and blue …

		In the end,  I too stand tamed
Now that he’s ill,  why fight with a sick man
I’ve mastered forgiveness

Now even his snores sound sweet
I try to listen closely
to see if he’s calling out from his dreams

Maybe he can’t say it, but is holding it all back for now
some sweet secret,
something so sweet that I’ve been yearning to hear
something that will change the map of my life
and then there’ll be a downpour
in this desert.

<em>Translation from Hindi  by  Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">“TO BE OR NOT”</h4>

<em>“My marriage bed is above the noose” -Mirabai</em>

This much English I learned to understand
the meaning of this line
but wish I could’ve learned Englishness well enough
to tie a knot in a noose, a tie,  
my shoelaces  too.
I can’t even tie ribbons on right
again and again on my way to school  they came undone
the red ribbons at the end of my braids
	Really annoyed, my poor brother
each time he had to tie them back on
And now when it’s my turn to tie a noose
it comes loose, opens up
like the amulet of folksongs.

“To be … or not to be ….”  Shakespeare reminds us 
It’s a whole ritual,  turning your sari
into a noose on the fan
It’s not so easy to tie it on
There’s a thick layer of dust on the fanblades
Before I hang myself, should I wipe it away with my anchal?

“To be dust,   or wipe it away, “  that’s the question  
Where are  Birbal and Vidushak of the Sanskrit plays
The wise fools of Shakespeare, where are they?
Where is the sly wit  of Telani Raman and Gonu Jha?

I met you in dusty folds of the stories my father told me
Come, get up and see me off!
Come, let’s giggle and gossip around the village fire
Let’s light the flames, there’s a chill in here
My skin’s not enough;
will they wrap me up  —
my own warm ashes?
Inside my stiff bones burns a slow fire,
the sweet potatoes on it,  will they satisfy my hunger?
Will lye and phenyl quench my thirst?
“To be or  not to be …”
Tired out, both my kids lie sleeping
In the morning, will they be shocked  ?
The little one can’t even comb his hair
and the big one, even worse
can’t tell the right side of a sock from the wrong.
They‘ll  get up, try to wake me up
   ‘Missed the schoolbus and the milkman’s gone home’
Everyone’s gone home,  shouldn’t I? 
Strange are the ways of this king’s court
One sepoy holds me back by the wrists 
while another’s ready to banish me forever
Yes,  Shakespeare,   I understand  
Understand this whole rigmarole 
of To Be or Not to Be.

<h4 class="yellow">TRANSLATION</h4>

People are going away
Each one from the other
People are going away
and the space around me is expanding.

I translate this ‘space’
not as ‘breathing space’
but ‘outer space’
because I sent my flying saucers out there.

Thank you,  time
my watch has stopped
Thank you, window
just behind the grille a sparrow 
is ready to lay her eggs.

Whoever, wherever, thanks to all of you
This is the time you ‘re all within me
I,  a little bit in each of you.

		The harmonium of my empty house
whines its moaning silence.
This empty time 
filled with work
This is the time when I  must translate
dirty linen into the dialect of water
Then a little while, stand still and think
if a sinkful of soapy water
can be translated 
into the melody of a  raga 
Frankly,  this whole house
I’d like to translate
into some other language.
But where will I find this language
except in the babblings of my children.
By the time I finish,  it’s evening
I’ll translate this evening into drawing the curtains
the splinters of last light
will fill up all the space
I’ll translate those splinters
not into outer space
but into my 
breathing space.

<h4 class="yellow">UNEMPLOYED</h4>

These days I’m reading only ancient scripts
Can manage to make out even the Harappan script
Every language is a language of pain
ever since I understood
I could read a message even
in the most obscure of languages
In my own infinite emptiness
this is the only thing I’ve done
I’ve learned the tottering notation of music
in every tone of pain.
There’s a fire in me 
to write something on the pages of the wind
and then crumple them up and toss them under the broken charpoy
Unfolding these crumpled scraps, 
my mother reads them
and her glasses fog up.
This is where my fire gets transformed into water.

My bound hands are restless
they want to do something.
There’s strength in them still.
Milk, they can draw from the breasts of the mountain
What if only a mouse turns up 
when you’ve dug it all up?

My bound hands are rough and cold —
they’ve never had the chance to sweep up the sweetness of the earth
Never has a  tattered dupatta  been held spread out between these hands
and laughingly begged those berries.

The moon is no longer that pale
There’s a layer of dirt on its yellowness
it‘s as grungy as the grayed pages of a miserly bania’s ledger
The sunlight slowly fading,
 like the tired, dusty beauty of an unwed elder sister

Hey, butterfly,     tell me 
how far is the last sigh from infinite desire.
This ‘should’,    what kind of a bird is this?
Has it ever alighted in your courtyard?
perched on your hand?
So how can they say  
a bird in the hand is worth more
than two in the bush?

Wringing my hands, I often wonder
are my hands two flints
will they ever trigger  fire?
I never get a wink of sleep
My life is the chaos at a call-center
that might close down any moment,  who knows?

<h4 class="yellow">WITHOUT A PLACE</h4>

This is how the shloka  goes —
    women, nails and hair
    once they’ve fallen
    	    just can’t be put back
	said our Sanskrit teacher.

Frozen in place out of fear
we girls held on tight to our seats.
Place,  what is this ‘place’?
We were shown our place
in the first grade.
We remembered our elementary school lessons
	Ram,  Go to school, son, 
	Radha, Go and cook !
	Ram, here is your candy,son, 
	Radha,  bring your broom!
	Ram,  bedtime,  school tomorrow
	Radha,  go and make the bed for brother.
	Aha!,  this is our new house
	Look Ram!,  here’s your room
	   	                                         “and mine?”
	Oh, little loony!
		Girls are wind, the sun and the good earth	
	They have no homes
				               “those without a home,
		 			     where do they belong?”

Which is the place from where we fall,
become clipped nails,  fallen hair trapped in combs,
fit only to be swept away?
Houses left behind, paths left behind
people left behind
the questions chasing us,  too   left behind.
Leaving tradition behind,
now I feel I’m as out of context 
as a short line
from a great classic
scribbled on a BA examination paper.

But I don’t want
somebody to sit down and
analyze me 
to pigeonhole me.
At long last,  beyond all contexts  
it’s been really hard
but I’ve gotten here.

Let me be hummed
like an abhang,
unfinished.
 
<em>Translation from Hindi by Arlene Zide and the poet</em>



<h4 class="yellow">WOMEN</h4>

We were read
like the torn pages of children’s notebooks
made into cones to hold warm chanajorgaram  

We were looked at
the way grumpily, you squint at your wristwatch 
after the alarm goes off in the morning.

We were listened to
distractedly
the way filmsongs assail your ears
spilling from cheap cassettes on a crowded bus

They sensed us
the way you sense the sufferings of a distant relative
One day we said
we’re human too.
Read us carefully
one letter at a time
they way after your BA,  you’d read a job ad.

Look at us
the way, shivering,  
you’d  gaze at the flames of a distant fire
Listen to us
as you would  the unstruck music of the void
and understand the way you’d understand a newly-learned language

The moment they heard this
from an invisible branch suspended in limbo
like a swam of gnats
wild rumors went screeching
  “Women without character
   wild vines draining the sap
   from their hosts 
 well-fed,  bored with affluence
 these women
 pointlessly on edge

 indulging in the luxury of writing
 these stories and poems  —
 not even their own,”
They said,  amused.

The rest of the stories dismissed with a wink



Hey,  Blessed Fathers
you blessed men
spare us 
spare us
this sort
of attention.
