<h4 class="yellow">HUNTING THE UNICORN </h4>

Stepping lightly along cresting waves
he was now a speck on the far horizon
clouded round with sky-blue leaves -
and behind him a pack of hounds and huntsmen
blundering about baying and blowing horns
sinking in bogs and overgrown gulleys 
His watery eyes
reflected the sea wind's veins 
There were 37 huntsmen
and 31 hounds, the best of their breed 
the above facts were set down in a district office
in the presence of numerous witnesses
but we still lack the data
needed to say what equals x 
Listening in the distance
to the barking of horns
and the crack of thickets and branches
he pauses
milk-white and solitary
veiled in a landscape of ferns
lit by a sun of edgy leaves 
And so on a warm day he set off for the west
on a wave of blue wind 
but we still lack the relevant facts 

<em>translated by Iain Higgins</em>
 


<h4 class="yellow">SCIENCE FICTION </h4>

On this three-dimensional planet
sprung from cosmic dust
the cherry blooms and the oriole sings
water finds its own level Newton's laws
tolerate no exceptions, at dusk the lindens
saturate the air, a man,
laying his hand on a woman's breast,
will say he loves her. 

<em>translated by Iain Higgins </em>
 


<h4 class="yellow">FIRST SNOW </h4>

on the first day of our era
on the island of sumiram the first snow fell 
patterns of stars covered
the indolent green of the tropical forests
on the island of sumiram 
while on the first day of our era
snow was falling on the island of sumiram
the inhabitants slept
while the inhabitants slept on the island of sumiram
snow was falling
when they woke from the cold the snow
had already vanished into the underbrush 
some maintain simply that on the first day of our era
a plague and an earthquake depopulated
the island of sumiram 
no wonder then
that both contemporary sources
and later traditions
tell us nothing
about the snow
which evidently spared the island of sumiram 

<em>translated by Iain Higgins </em>

 

<h4 class="yellow">WORDS AND DUST </h4>

People brush against life
brush against the foreshadowings of trees and rocks
brush against themselves
lately they've begun to brush against
distant continents against the stars even 
Thanks to this osmosis a view from the grey universe
has opened onto pines lakes glaciers and lions
they glisten display their hues and laugh in the sun
silhouetted in the moon's glow
now flint is sparking poetry flashes
love is aflame the eye focussed 
Now death rubs against people
they crumble crack disintegrate
their dust their rubble their fine cinders
settle on trees rocks on the stars even
a film of grey covers objects
both real and conventional
it's no longer possible to distinguish
thrones from kings memory from divination
women from roses or priests from damnation 

<em>translated by Iain Higgins </em>
 
 
 
<h4 class="yellow">YOU AND I </h4>

We carved boats from rust-coloured bark;
we shall make masts out of twigs
and sails from torn newspapers;
here on the wrinkled puddle
we'll give them to the wind. 
And there they are now
drifting to the very centre
tossing and trembling
beyond our reach. 
Above us the murmur of bare trees
and a pale spectral sun. 
Sometimes we also walk
to the edge of the great clear waters
and even to the foaming
sea, where we play
ducks and drakes, which skip skip on the water
fly briefly then sink. 
This is our dialogue. 
Let the winter branches speak for us
or the sailboats of oak bark,
now somewhere well out on the boundless
ocean. 

<em>translated by Iain Higgins </em>
 


<h4 class="yellow">FOR THE MUSES' RETURN </h4>

Three or maybe two
came
from fields now sated with milky darkness;
they merged with the contours of pines and melodies
and turned the pale afterglow of a somnolent sky
into gusty wind. 
I no longer see them
but now read with difficulty:
<em>You are here on the 27th July 1991
conscious
though fearful;
record this moment,
note it down.
Time flows in you
falls into waters of unbeing
in which you will vanish;
leave a trace
perhaps someone lost in the evening
will find shelter here;
leave a light
in the window. </em>
