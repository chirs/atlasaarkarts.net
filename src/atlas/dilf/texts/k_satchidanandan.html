<h4 class="yellow">A MAN WITH A DOOR</h4>

A man walks with a door
along the city street;
he looks for its house.

He had once dreamt
of his woman, children and friends
coming in through the door.
Now he sees a whole world
pass through this door
of his never-built house:
men, vehicles,trees,
beasts, birds,everything.

And the door, its dream 
rising above the earth,
longs to be the door of Heaven;
imagines clouds,rainbows,
demons, fairies and saints 
pass through it 
and shines like gold.

But it is the owner of Hell
who awaits the door.
Now it just yearns 
to be its tree,full of foliage
swaying in the breeze,
just to provide some shade
to its homeless haulier.

A man walks with a door
along the citystreet ;
a star walks with him.

<em>(Translated from the Malayalam by the poet)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">ANGELS</h4>

Angels do not live on moonlight.
They know nothing about relativity.
They make light of the law of gravity.
Since they have wings in place of hands
They cannot properly handle even a cup of tea,
count change or  set a blown fuse,
not to speak of sending an SMS.

Angels hate to take part in funeral rites.
All that stuff about their standing guard
to the sick  and singing lullabies for
those sleeping on the streets
is nothing but bluff.

Their relationship with God is in jeopardy.
In fact they were banished from Heaven
for their lethargy and indulgence.
Names like  Gabriel and Raphael 
they picked up after they were
abandoned on earth. 
They are suffering from diabetes and B. P .
as they  had long been on 
an excess of manna.
Human drugs have failed on them.
Veterenary doctors think
their wings are fake.
But they are real as they
get entangled in microwave towers : 
it is their wail that
we just heard on our mobiles.

Angels envy men :
thought is anathema to them.
They survive only as they are gay.

Once I saw  a wingless angel
riding the back of a local train.
Its eyes were  no more than sockets
and the cheeks  had no cheeks in them.
Seeing it try hard to sing aawaaraa hoom *
with its sooty lips
to the accompaniment 
of the train’s whistle,
I wept.

<em>(Translated from the original  Malayalam by the poet)</em>

<em>awaaraa hoom  : a Hindi film song popularised by the actor Rajkapoor, the words mean, “ I am a vagabond”.</em>



<h4 class="yellow">CACTUS</h4>

Thorns are my language.
I announce my existence
with a bleeding touch.

Once these thorns were flowers.
I loathe lovers who betray.
Poets have abandoned the deserts
to go back to the gardens.
Only camels remain here, and merchants,
who trample my blooms  to dust.

One thorn for each rare drop of water.
I don’t tempt butterflies,
no bird sings my praise.
I don’t yield to droughts.

I create another beauty
beyond the moonlight,
this side of dreams,
a sharp,piercing,
parallel language.

<em>(Translated from the Malayalam by the poet)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">HOW TO GO TO THE TAO TEMPLE</h4>

Don’t lock the door.
Go lightly like the leaf in the breeze
along the dawn’s valley.
If you are too fair,
cover yourself with ash.
If too clever, go half-asleep.
That which is fast
will tire fast : 
be slow, slow as stillness.

Be formless like water.
Lie low,don’t even try to go up.
Don’t go round the deity : 
nothingness has no directions,
no front nor back.
Don’t call it by name,
its name has no name.
No offerings: empty pots
are easier to carry than full ones.
No prayers too: desires 
have no place here.

Speak silently, if speak you must:
like the rock speaking to the trees
and leaves to flowers.
Silence is the sweetest of voices
and Nothingness has
the fairest of colours.

Let none see you coming 
and none, going.
Cross the threshold shrunken 
like one crossing a river in winter.
You have only a moment  here
like the melting snow.

No pride: you are not even formed.
No anger: not even dust
is at your command.
No sorrow: it doesn’t alter anything.
Renounce greatness:
there is no other way to be great.
Don’t ever use your hands:
They are contempalting
not love ,but vilolence.

Let the fish lie in its water
and the fruit, on its bough.
The soft one shall survive the hard, 
like the tongue that survives teeth. 
Only the one who does nothing 
can do everything.

Go, the unmade idol 
awaits you.

<em>(From  The Northern Canto 1994)</em>

<em>(Translated from the Malayalam by the poet)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">STAMMER</h4>

Stammer is no handicap.
It is a mode of speech.

Stammer is the silence that falls
between the word and its meaning,
just as lameness is the
silence that falls between 
the word and the deed.

Did stammer precede language
or succeed it?
Is it only a dialect or
a language itself?
These questions make 
the linguists stammer.

Each time we stammer
we are offering a sacrifice
to the God of meanings.

When a whole people stammer 
stammer becomes their mother-tongue:
just as it is with us now.

God too must have stammered 
when He created man.
That is why all the words of man 
carry different meanings.
That is why everything he utters 
from his prayers to his commands 
stammers, 
like poetry.

<em>(Translated from the Malayalam by the poet)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">COOL,HOT</h4>

In Delhi’s cold 
I recall my mother,
the first warmth 
that had enveloped me.

I could not take mother to Kasi,
not even her lullaby.
That remorse has a compartment 
in every train that shuttles 
between Delhi and Benares.

Standing on the banks 
of Ganga with my lifemate
I thought: could have brought 
at least mother’s ashes for Ganga.

There was no shortage of ashes,
nor of dead bodies;
but mother had lived 
and died in Malayalam.
‘Ram nam sach hei’ would have
turned her an alien.

Yet the Lord knew her
with her coolness.
Didn’t she  hide in that 
unoiled matted hair?*
Here, she flows in front of me.
Let me wash my feet in her.
It may not expiate my sins;
but is cool like affection, soiled.

Reaching home in Delhi
I turn on the water-tap:
Here comes Ganga, purified.
How did mother manage
to pass through this pipe?

“O, I took a magic potion: Death.
Now I can take any shape,
can go anywhere.”

I scooped her up in my hands:
And got cooled,
In Delhi’s heat.

<em>(Translated from the Malayalam by the poet)</em>

<em>*Remember  Siva hiding Ganga in his tangled hair.</em>
