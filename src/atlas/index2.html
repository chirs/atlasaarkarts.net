<p class="padded_bottom"><strong>ATLAS &#8212; a book[maga]zine of "new writing, art & image" &#8212; is edited & designed by Sudeep Sen. It was launched in the UK, USA & India in 2006, and very quickly established itself as one of the leading international magazines of its kind. It presents the best of Indian and international writing to India and the world.</strong> </p>

<p>Atlas is a gallimaufry of literature the purpose of which is, in the words of its editor Sudeep Sen, "to present the best of Indian and international writing to India and the world." In this it succeeds beautifully. A new, fiercely bright torch has been lit. 
<br />&#8212; MURROUGH O'BRIEN in <em class="blue">The Independent on Sunday</em></p>

<p>Atlas represents the first self-styled 'bookzine'. Contents prove enticing ... 
<br />making [its] mark in the margins. &#8212; TRAVIS ELBOROUGH in <em class="blue">The Guardian</em> </p>

<p>Nota Bene.  &#8212; <em class="blue">The Times Literary Supplement</em></p>

<p>It's difficult to decide which aspect of Atlas is most impressive: the masthead, the number of editorial offices, or the magazine.s sheer girth (400 pages). But however jaw-dropping those may be, readers will be most impressed by the table of contents. 
<br />&#8212; KEVIN LARIMER in <em class="blue">Poets & Writers Magazine</em></p>

<p>A world-class magazine &#8212; a steal of a collector's item. 
<br />&#8212; ANJANA RAJAN in <em class="blue">The Hindu</em></p>

<p>Do we need another literary magazine? If it's Atlas, the answer's a resounding yes.

<p>Aark Arts was founded and formed by an international group of creative writers, artists, critics, academics and professionals and began its operation in London as a literary and arts publisher in the 1990s.</p>

<p>The first title was published in 1995 and since then in its first dozen years, it has published over 50 titles. Now with publishing associates in three continents and offices/outlets in the United Kingdom & Europe, North America, and South Asia, it is global and contemporary in scope.</p>
<p>Aark Arts publishes fine literature & the arts &#8212; poetry, literary fiction & non-fiction, translation, drama, spoken work compact disc, photography, art, anthology, journal and magazine.</p>
<p>Aark Arts believes in the integrity of the creative artist's personal and distinctive voice and vision as its essential focus. It is not driven by commerce, market forces, or by targets in terms of numbers of books it has to put out in a year. It publishes only what the editors believe to be original and cutting-edge contributions to the the artistic and literary field - the only criterion being high quality, and that alone.</p>
