<h4 class="yellow">SASKATCHEWAN …</h4>

<em>… has more poets per capita
than any other province in Canada.
----Saskatchewan Culture of the Arts leaflet</em>

Walking
on water is easy.

The miracle
is not in the journey

but in choosing
when to return.

On the prairies,
winter is about patience -

white falling,      
white falling on white -

moon
turning it blue.

Winter is silence -
all things dead

or dreaming
the beauty of nothing -

no colour, no smell,
no life.

The only warmth
ice on your tongue

the cold demanding
everyone be kind.

Everyone here
is a poet

the homeless
sleep in libraries

the abandoned
read between dreams.



<h4 class="yellow">To the Dead</h4>
<em>for Dom</em>

Move on. Change your friends.
Your job. Your family.

Sing sad love songs and change
all the pronouns.

Watch Late Night TV
and while you watch, read

bad novels, furiously, fingers
ready to turn the next page.

Avoid Talk Shows.
Don't write letters. Drink.

Fall down. Smile at strangers.
Cook with garlic

and onions.
Ring me. 

This time
I might
answer.



<h4 class="yellow">not drowning - Bloomsbury 2008</h4>
<em>for Malcolm</em>

In this group of wildly
cautious poets
organic is good, but

good elderberry port
goes untouched 
sloe gin is too fast

our motto is
nothing gained:
good

somewhere in Paris
Kiki is dancing

we are not there.



<h4 class="yellow">Lives of the Poets: Poets in Residence</h4>

The problem with artists as house-guests
Is they don't go away.
You can't fold them up in their suitcase
And take them down to the station.
They arrive with one bag or two of their own
And leave with three more of yours
And take you with them
To carry their luggage
And broken trolleys

All artists have bad backs.
So do I.

The problem with artists as house guests
Is they want you to listen to their rants
Over breakfast, through your favourite show,
At three in the morning when they
Come into your room with tequila and salt
And bounce on your bed.

The only time they are silent
They are tongue-kissing your lover.

The problem with artists as house guests
Is they are all larger than life
And spend most of it trying to end it:
I have nothing to live for,
Just let me die. Oh please, please please
I'd be better off dead
Until you agree

Or they cry because they can't have children
With you.

Artists as house-guests need feeding
Three times an hour
If you leave them any longer
You find them hungrily
Eyeing the baby.

The problem with artists as house-guests
Is when they sleep, they burn your carpet
Or their beards or set fire to your bed
Dropping lit cigarettes

They all cook either badly or well
But they all cook using every pot in the house
They drop fag ashes
Beating eggs for the omelettes
And roll joints for your mother

And after they wash up
All your non-stick pans
Stick.

And the damn thing of it is:

The problem with artists as house guests
Is that when, eventually, they go away
You miss them.



<h4 class="yellow">For Serena</h4>

You are there

baking for Christmas, siphoning
wine in the afternoon

laughing at The Singer Not the Song
your first schoolgirl crush

in Sales I see your colours:
Cinnamon, Spice, Terracotta, Rust

I put them back
for someone else

breathing in the Blackened Orange 
the small ache of cloves

Red Sand; Dust.


<em>('for Serena' published in Painted, spoken, number 14 (London:Richard Price 2007)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">ONE YEAR ON</h4>

The reading-corner you made me
is still there

bright red table, red chairs
picture railings, dove-grey stairs

still lit by west light

There are no sounds
in the house I remember

no one calling     no one called
no one there

the cedar of the floor still smells sweet

as the light from the window
turns to dark

<em>('One year On' published in DIVERS (London: Aark Arts 2008)</em>



<h4 class="yellow">IMAGINE ROSE DANCING</h4>

<em>Rose Hacker's Dance Performance in Bloomsbury
February 24, 2007</em>

Imagine Rose dancing
white lace at her throat
dark dress falling shoulders 
                               to floor                   

the lights catching stage dust
the slow curve of thin wrists

                               suspended

Rose dancing,
still turning heads
each breath that she takes
                                lemon-sweet

imagine Rose dancing
to one-hundred-and-one
imagine Rose dancing
                    and dance!
